# ON PROCESS NOT FULLY COMPLETE
# BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


The ‚ÄúBank Account Management System‚Äù project is a model Internet Banking Site. This site enables the customers to perform the basic banking transactions by sitting at their office or at homes through PC or laptop. The system provides the access to the customer to create an account, deposit/withdraw the cash from his account, also to view reports of all accounts present. The customers can access the banks website for viewing their Account details and perform the transactions on account as per their requirements.
